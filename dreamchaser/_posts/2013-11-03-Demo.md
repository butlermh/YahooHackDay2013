We have cooked up a number of recipes for working with open data.

First we got data sets from [data.taipei.gov.tw](http://data.taipei.gov.tw) and [data.gov.tw](http://data.gov.tw). We used a simple web crawler to retrieve the data, along with some tricks to query Google because the sites do not have machine readable data catalogs.

Then we created a simple sample of how the data sets can be browsed using [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com). This required the use of a service, [Json2JsonP](http://json2jsonp.com/), because the open data sites do not support [JSONP (JSON with padding)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP). We also showed how YUI could also be used to map the many schema differences in these datasets to a common schema.

Then we used Exhibit, a data visualization framework, to explore both the metadata catalog of all the datasets, and some of the data sets. We wrote a Python script to help with exporting the data to [Exhibit](http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/). We also skinned Exhibit using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to create a compelling web design.

Finally we demonstrated how some simple tools can be used to convert some JSON datasets to CSV, import the data into a relational database, and then use the [D2RQ](http://d2rq.org/) tool to expose this data as RDF via [SPARQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) making the open data available to the Semantic Web. We also explored some data modelling and schema mapping issues.

We documented our work using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static web framework which is used as the basis of [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). The documentation is important because this provides a hacking cook book for open data.
