A quick note about how this website was created: it was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static blogging framework for Ruby. Jekyll is used by Github pages {http://pages.github.com/. It uses [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as it's primary format. Some of our team are very keen on Python so they were initially not keen about using a different framework to Django but the hack day is a good opportunity to try new technologies. We used the [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) theme in Jekyll.

If you are interested in trying Jekyll, we followed [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin-with-rvm):

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm requirements
rvm install ruby
rvm use ruby --default
rvm rubygems current
gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

Then to create a new Jekyll site:

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}
