# Yahoo Hack Day 2013 - Dream chaser

We have cooked up a number of recipes for working with open data.

First we demonstrate using simple crawling tools to get large amounts of open data.

Then we show how to use [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com) tools to explore open data.

Then we use YUI to perform simple schema integration.

Next we create a simple Python tool to modify the JSON data so it can be imported into [Exhibit](http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/), a flexible data visualization tool. We demonstrate this approach for a number of data sets. We use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to create a rich front end to enhance Exhibit.

Finally we demonstrate how some simple tools can be used to convert some JSON datasets to CSV, then import the data into a relational database, and then use the [D2RQ](http://d2rq.org/) tool to expose this data as RDF via [SPARQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) making the open data available to the Semantic Web. We explore data modelling and schema mapping issues.

We documented our work using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static web framework which is used as the basis of [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). The documentation is important because this provides a hacking cook book for working with open data.
